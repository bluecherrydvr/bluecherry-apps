/* Motion_handler buffers input packets and uses motion detection results to
 * decide what to forward downstream for recording. This does not perform motion
 * detection; instead, it's responsible for taking raw motion flags on packets and
 * implementing prerecording, postrecording, event continuation, packet-count
 * thresholds, etc.
 *
 * For some devices (e.g. solo), motion flags can be set directly from the input,
 * and the above behaviors are done directly with the input stream. However, in cases
 * where motion detection is performed asynchronously from the input and possibly on
 * a limited subset of packets, this class also accepts a second stream of packets
 * with motion data added. That stream - which is expected to be a subset of the
 * buffer, is interleaved with the buffer to determine what to record, without
 * subjecting the recording to the same packet drop rules as the actual motion
 * detection. The goal is that motion detection can drop packets as needed to stay
 * realtime, but the recording (if any) will include all packets within the given
 * timeframe.

	 * Postrecord is how long after the last motion the recording will continue,
	 * also in seconds. Excessively low values will create too many recordings for
	 * intermittent motion.
	 *
	 * In addition, a motion recording is not closed until the last frame from the
	 * recording has fallen out of the prerecord buffer. If more motion is detected
	 * in that time, the intervening frames are dumped from the prerecord buffer and
	 * recording continues. If there is no motion, the recording is ended. This
