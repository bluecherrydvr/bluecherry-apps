/*
	duration.h

	Custom serializer for xsd:duration stored in a LONG64 with ms precision
	- a LONG64 int can represent 106751991167 days forward and backward
	- LONG64 is long long int under Unix/Linux
	- millisecond resolution (1/1000 sec) means 1 second = 1000
	- when adding to a time_t value, conversion may be needed since time_t
	  may (or may) not have seconds resolution
	- durations longer than a month are always output in days, rather than
	  months to avoid days-per-month conversion inacurracies
	- durations expressed in years and months are not well defined, since
	  there is no reference starting time; the decoder assumes 30 days per
	  month and conversion of P4M gives 120 days and therefore the duration
	  P4M and P120D are assumed identical, while they should give different
	  results depending on the reference starting time

	#import this file into your gSOAP .h file

	To automate the wsdl2h-mapping of xsd:dateTime to struct tm, add this
	line to the typemap.dat file:

	xsd__duration = #import "custom/duration.h" | xsd__duration

	The typemap.dat file is used by wsdl2h to map types (wsdl2h option -t).

	Compile and link your code with custom/duration.c
